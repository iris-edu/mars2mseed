mars2mseed - convert MARS 88/lite waveform data to Mini-SEED.

All data samples are scaled by 10 during this conversion, do not forget
to take this into account when using the resulting Mini-SEED.

-- Acknowledgements --

Aladino Govoni provided most of the base code for reading and parsing
MARS data blocks and was very helpful, many thanks.


-- Building/Installing --

In most environments a simple 'make' will build the program.

Using GCC, running 'make static' will compile a static version
if possible.

For Win32 (Windows) Open Watcom's wmake program can be used with
Makefile.wat (e.g. wmake -f Makefile.wat), this has only been tested
with Open Watcom 1.3.  Some untested Makefile.win files exist that
might work with Microsoft's nmake program.

For usage information see the man page in the doc directory.
